***Simplified HTML Markup Language (Or Simplified Hypertext Markup Language Markup Language)*** is a lightweight markup language parser built in JavaScript. The syntax is similar to that of Markdown, but with changes to make some things more intuitive. This software is distributed under the MIT license. A demo of SHML can be found [here](https://stevebeeblebrox.github.io/apps/shml).

***SHML blocks most forms of script injection; however, older browsers may stil have vulnerabilities. If security is important, use a dedicated sanitizer on the output from SHML before writing it to a document.***
